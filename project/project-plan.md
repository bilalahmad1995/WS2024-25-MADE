S&P 500 Companies Data

## Main Question

1. What sectors demonstrate the highest market capitalization and revenue growth in the S&P 500, and how do they compare in terms of EBITDA and employee count?

## Description

This project aims to analyze S&P 500 companies to identify sectors with the highest market capitalization and revenue growth, providing insights into high-growth areas in the U.S. stock market. Leveraging attributes such as sector, industry, current price, market capitalization, EBITDA, revenue growth, and employee count, this analysis offers a comprehensive view of the financial health and workforce distribution across major sectors.

The project will involve data preprocessing and tranformations to ensure accuracy, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends. By calculating sector-wise averages and using visualizations, we can observe how factors like market capitalization and revenue growth differ across sectors.

This analysis benefits investors, market analysts, and strategists seeking data-driven insights to support decision-making in financial investments. Understanding which sectors exhibit higher growth potential and profitability can help stakeholders make more informed choices regarding investments in these companies.
